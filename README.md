==================
Source code and scripts for the Webis Web Archiver

Quickstart
----------
You need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. On a Unix machine:
  - run src-bash/archive.sh for archiving web pages. It will display usage hints.
  - run src-bash/reproduce.sh for reproducing from an archive. It will display usage hints.
  
For other OSes, have a look at the shell scripts and adjust their call to docker run accordingly.
