webis-web-archiver
==================
Source code and scripts for the Webis Web Archiver

Quickstart
----------
You need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

Then, on a Unix machine:
  - run src-bash/archive.sh for archiving web pages. It will display usage hints.
  - run src-bash/reproduce.sh for reproducing from an archive. It will display usage hints.

The scripts will automatically download and run the image (2GB+ due to all the fonts).

For other OSes, have a look at the shell scripts and adjust the call to docker run accordingly.
